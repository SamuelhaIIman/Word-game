# Word Game
To initiate the process, start by creating a React app with the command `npx create-react-app example --template typescript`. Next, replace both the public and src files. To ensure functionality, execute `npm install react-dice-roll`, followed by the commands `npm config set legacy-peer-deps true` and `npm cache clean --force`. Conclude with a final npm install. Upon completion, the game should be ready to play, or you can access it directly through this link: https://digiruori.fi/pelit/r6/.

This project involved the creation of a React app with TypeScript integration, specifically designed for first graders learning letters. Developed within a five-man team, the project spanned five weeks, organized into five sprints for efficient collaboration and development.
